# REACTIVE LAND

## Welcome to Reactive land,
Where we go through a journey from reactive programming to reactive systems.
Our journey will happen through a series of short lecture (youtube) followed by an educational programming challenge.

### Who?
 - If you have an overall knowledge about reactive programming but never tried it before.
 - If you have tried reactive programming but it never worked

### Requirements:
 - Decent Java programming skills (Java 17 preferably)
 - Reading [Reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)
 
### Reading suggestions:
 - [projectreactor](https://projectreactor.io/) 
 - Overall Understanding of [Webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
 - Josh Long book: [reactive-spring](https://leanpub.com/reactive-spring)
 - watch [video from spring](https://youtu.be/IZ2SoXUiS7M)
### Rules of engagement:
 - PR for adding more tests and examples to each session.
   - In each episode, after the lecture, we will work on some programming challenges.
   When you solved one (in your group or alone), feel free to create a PR.
   If your answer is different from what has already merged, it will be merged.
   - Master branch (called `main`), will contain challenges and their solution answer.
   - If you want challenges without responses, you can check out the commit id in front of each episode added below.
   During each workshop, you should create a branch with a name identifying your group.
   When done, create a PR using that branch toward master.
