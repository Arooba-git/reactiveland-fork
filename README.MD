# REACTIVELAND

## Welcome to Reactiveland,
Where we go through journey from reactive programming to reactive systems.
Our journey will happen through a series of short lecture (youtube) followed by an educational programming challenge.

### Requirements:
 - Decent Java programming skills (Java 17 preferably)
 - Reading [Reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)
 - Understanding [projectreactor](https://projectreactor.io/) and how it's useful 
 - Understanding [Webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html) and how it's useful

### Rules of engagement:
 - PR for adding more tests and examples to each session.
   - In each episode, after the lecture, we will work on one programming challenge.
   When you solved one (in your group or alone), feel free to create a PR.
   If your answer is different from what has already merged, it will be merged.
   - Master branch, will contain up to the latest challenge and answer to the previous ones.
   During each workshop, you should create a branch with a name identifying your group.
   When done, create a PR using that branch.
